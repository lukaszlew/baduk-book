## Teaching of beginners
- Create a positive and supportive learning environment to prevent discouragement.
- Avoid discussing bad moves and focus solely on praising good moves.
- Acknowledge and build upon the aspects of the game that the learner is satisfied with.
- Encourage the learner to feel that they played well and want to repeat it.
- Use open-ended questions like "What do you think about this move?" and let the learner evaluate it themselves.
- Strive for a balanced mix of positive and negative feedback, with a ratio of 10:1 for beginners.
- Highlight improvement and progress rather than dwelling on mistakes.
- Be mindful of the psychological impact of feedback, especially with beginners.
- Foster a dialogue about moves and strategies rather than monologue.
