The ladder works when the player attempting to capture manages to capture the opponent's stones.
When checking if the ladder works, we look at the outermost (diagonal) stones.

## Ladder breaking

The ladder does NOT work when the escaping player's stone (ladder breaker) is in the path of the ladder in three ways:

- The stone is inside the ladder (two diagonals) - it connects with the escaping stones.
- The stone is at one of the the outermost diagonals  - also connects with the escaping stones.
- The stone touches the ladder from the outside - it places the outer diagonal stone in atari.

## Helpful hoshi:

The position of the stone in the ladder in relation to the hoshi will be the same in relation to the next hoshi 
(on the board below, the stones are three spaces to the right of the hoshi).
